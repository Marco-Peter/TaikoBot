# Membership Expectations
## COVID-19 Protective Measures

The following COVID-19 protective measures are mandatory for all members:

**Occupancy** of the elevators and the dojo may not exceed 2 and 30 persons, respectively, at a single time.

**Inform** the designated dojo contact immediately if you had close contact with someone with COVID-19 or experienced symptoms and quarantine for 10 days.

**Face masks** are mandatory and must be worn by all persons within the building, regardless of COVID certificate status, unless otherwise stated. FFP2/FFP3 masks (without vents) are recommended while properly fitted surgical masks are the minimum requirement.

**Shouting & singing** will be done solely by the teacher to a limited extent to minimise aerosol emissions.

**Physical distancing** (1.5 meters) should be observed as much as possible.

**Contact tracing** is critical to mitigating outbreaks amongst our members. Therefore, careful attendance self-management via TaikoBot is required by all.

**Good hygiene** should be exercised by washing or disinfecting before and after training.

In addition to the above, the designated Fundamentals teacher or Open Renshu facilitator is responsible to ensure the following:

**Adherence** to the above measure by all members.

**Validation** of member attendance and COVID-19 certificates.

**Ventilation** in both dojo rooms will be activated 30 minutes before training commences until 2 hours after the training has ended.

## General conduct
All students are expected to exercise their utmost tolerance and consideration towards others before, during and after training.

## Outside of the dōjō
Manage your training dates with our TaikoBot. Students are required to submit absences, preferably well in advance, as an important part of our dojo’s rules of etiquette to allow others to take your spot. If you fail to do this, your compensation privileges will be suspended.

- Sign out: Submit absence dates at least 7 hours in advance. This good ‹Taiko Karma› will be saved for the rest of the semester. Holiday dates are blocked out.
- Sign in: Select compensation dates that suit your schedule spontaneously. This is possible until the training begins. Full training dates are blocked out.

## At the dōjō
Each training begins and ends by reflecting on these points when bowing to the group as well as at the entrance of the dōjō:

- Respect for your teacher
- Respect for the dojo and instruments
- Respect for your fellow members
- Respect for yourself
- Respect for the art

Please ensure that you arrive at training on-time. If you arrive late, warm-up on your own before the teacher gives your permission to enter the training room. 

Before training begins help prepare taiko and other equipment, stretch and warm yourself up. 

If you have to leave early or have an injury, inform the teacher before training begins. 

No food or sugary drinks are allowed in the dōjō. 

Remove your shoes before entering. 

Leave your belongings neatly in the changing area. 

### The beginning of training
The class forms a circle. 

Everyone bows and says:

お願いします 

Onegai shimasu 
Please do me this favour.

### The end of training

The class forms a circle.
The teacher bows after saying:

お疲れ様でした

Otsukaresama deshita (Thank you for your hard work).

The students bow after replying:

ありがとうございました 

Arigatō gozaimashita (Thank you very much).

## Equipment and instruments
All equipment and instruments must be treated with respect: 

- Move and stack the taiko with care. Do not lean or place objects on the taiko. Ensure that taiko are placed correctly in the appropriate stand. Move taiko, bachi or dai with your hands, not your feet!
- Do not drag the taiko on the floor. Pick them up with a partner. 
- Taiko may not be played until given permission to do so. 
- Check your bachi regularly for defects: 
  - Remove any splinters or dirt with sandpaper.
  - Do not play with damaged bachi as they can hurt your hand and the taiko. Show your bachi to the teacher if you are unsure.

Bachi should be placed down gently next to the taiko or along the walls of the dojō to prevent tripping hazards.
