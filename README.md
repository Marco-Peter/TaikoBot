# Taikobot

Taikobot targets to help organizing Taiko courses and workshop as well as getting news and information out to the members.

Since it still is in a very early development stage, a lot can (and probably will) change over the time.

Currently features at work are:
- Create edit and manage Courses with the lessons as well as workshops
- Let all members see their currently signed in courses as well as their upcoming lessons. Also give them a way to manage their participation in the lessons.
- Let members sign into new workshops and courses online.
- Give teachers a simple tool to plan out lessons by using the lesson notes.

Intended features and ideas for the future
- Send notifications to the users about upcoming lessons and important messages.
- have a simple message board between teachers and the students of a course.
- Have supporting material like note sheets and documents for the participants of a course.

## Installation and development

Taikobot builds on top of the Laravel framework (see below) and their Jetstream starter kit

For develpment purposes it can be used in a PHP8.1 or newer environment, which can be run natively on the computer or in a Docker container using Laravel Sail.

### Setup of Sail-Environment (Docker)
1. Clone repository into a directory under the WSL or Linux environment.
2. Execute the sail_setup.sh script.
3. Start sail (`.vendor/bin/sail up -d`, or `sail up -d`, when shell alias is set).
4. Install JavaScript dependencies (`sail npm install`).
5. Migrate database (`sail artisan migrate --seed`).
6. Generate application encryption key (`sail artisan key:generate`).
7. Build the javascript files (`sail npm run build`).

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
